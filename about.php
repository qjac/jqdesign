        	<p>I am a straightforward, strategic designer and web developer who loves working with the movers, shakers, and do-gooders. You know, people don’t live in bubbles&mdash;and neither should design. With a background in non-profits and education and a future in design and web development, I try to solve tough problems to build powerful brands, stronger communities, and a more equitable and sustainable world.</p>
